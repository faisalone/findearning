                                A great commerce experience cannot be distilled to a single number. It’s not a
                                Lighthouse
                                score, or a set of Core Web Vitals figures, although both are important inputs. A great
                                commerce experience is a trilemma that carefully balances competing needs of delivering
                                great customer experience, dynamic storefront
                                capabilities, and long-term business — conversion, retention, re-engagement —
                                objectives. As
                                developers, we rightfully obsess about the customer experience, relentlessly working to
                                squeeze every millisecond out of the critical rendering path, optimize input latency,
                                and
                                eliminate jank. At the limit, statically generated, edge delivered, and HTML-first pages
                                look like the optimal strategy. That is until you are confronted with the realization
                                that
                                the next step function in improving conversion rates and business.
